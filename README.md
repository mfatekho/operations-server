# Intento Task - Server Application

## Task Description

Create the table of operations entities, which contains two columns [name, status]. When a user clicks by "Create"
button, he sees the operation creation modal. User can input the name of the new operation. After clicking the "Create"
button in the modal, a new operation appears in the table with the status In Progress. The Backend service must finish
the new operation with Done or Failed after 5 seconds. You decide on your own how the user will know about the updates
of the status column in the operations list.
